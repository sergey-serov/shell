<h2>Backup all</h2>

Before any works with infected sites will be started strongly necessary backup all data from server.

What is necessary to backup.

<ul>
<li>Sites document roots.</li>
<li>Databases.</li>
<li>Configs for all services. Often - it is enough just backup directory /etc - it contents configs to nginx, httpd, mysql and local services like cron.</li>
<li>Configs for user programs - like vim, bashrc etc. In common way - this is all system (with dot before name, for example '.vim') files and directories in user home directory.</li>
<li>Nginx and httpd logs for additional analyze <b>if You have time for this ;)</b>.</li>
<li>If you really want to explore how a site was attacked and have time for it - backup also system logs in /var/log</li>
<li>Any another data, which You probably store somewhere on the disk. All what necessary for saving sites data with usually settings were mentioned above.</li>
</ul>

<b>Do not download files to local workstation</b> if have not antivirus monitor with fresh databases (will be described below)!


<h2>Rescue process. On local workstation.</h2>


<h3>Antivirus</h3>

<b>First of all we need antivirus!</b> For example Sophos: www.sophos.com
Good antivirus for web spheare - it finds shells and all others 'bad' files. More others - it control all process in local system and block dangerous for system actions.
They have trial version - it is enough to rescue sites :)

Additionally if on local workstation is linux - You may install scaner ClamAV. But this is just only additionally to Sophos (or similar with real-time antivirus monitor).


<h3>Prepare workspace.</h3>

For rescue sites we will need workspace - incubator. Place where no any malicius script cannot execute and were we will be find malicious files and fragments.

<code>mkdir /home/sergey/forge-home/4_security/incubator</code>

To continue futhure You <b>MUST</b> have antivirus monitor (see above).
Download backups and place site files and database dump to this incubator.
Change directory in this place. Unpack all archive.

<code>cd /home/sergey/forge-home/4_security/incubator</code>

Correct local owner for all files.
Here and fourther when You will need run command as root - use 'sudo'.

<code>chown -R sergey:sergey ./*</code>

Remove execute permission from all files:

<code>find . -type f -exec chmod a-x {} \;</code>

Remove control version files if they exists:

<code>find . -name '.git' -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;</code>


<h3>Work with site files and mysqldump</h3>

Check with system antivirus. Collect list with bad files, delete them all:

<code>sudo freshclam</code>

<code>sudo clamscan -r -i .</code>

<code>savscan . -archive</code>

Search in sql and in files specific for suspicious patterns. Consider context for every inset. If these are new not-drupal files - delete them:

<code>find . -type f -name '*.php' -o -name '*.sql' | xargs egrep -i "(preg_replace|base64_decode|\$_COOKIE|\$_POST|mail|fsockopen|pfsockopen|stream_socket_client|file_put_contents|php_eval|phpinfo|SimplePie|PHP_OS|FilesMan|exec|ob_start|phpinfo|passthru|system|eval|php_flag engine on|assert|iframe) *\("</code>

<code>find . -type f -name '*.*' | xargs egrep -i "(preg_replace|base64_decode|\$_COOKIE|\$_POST|mail|fsockopen|pfsockopen|stream_socket_client|file_put_contents|php_eval|phpinfo|SimplePie|PHP_OS|FilesMan|exec|ob_start|phpinfo|passthru|system|eval|php_flag engine on|assert|iframe) *\("</code>

Additionally search in sql only:
<code>find . -type f -name '*.sql' | xargs egrep -i '(<\?php|iframe)'</code>

Search in non php files php code:

<code>find . -type f -not -name '*.php' -o -not -name '*.inc' -o -not -name '*.module' -print0 | xargs -0 egrep -i '(<\?php|<\?=|<\? *(?!(xml)))'</code>

Finally - search all php files and check if they 'good'.

Some of this pattern very good for automated checks for all uploaded on the server files in future when we will buid defence system.

<code>find . -type f -name '*.php'</code>

Find obfuscated and encrypted with neopi
https://github.com/neohapsis/neopi
A lot of positiv false here - this is optional just additional tool
/home/sergey/forge-home/4_security/neopi.py --csv=neopi-scan-result.scv --all .
Delete file report after read ./neopi-scan-result.scv

<i>This is useful to open with vim editor bad several files to understand what they are for education purposes.</i>


<h3>Work with database only</h3>

Restore database with new user and new password:

<code>mysql -u root -p --one-database db_name < mysqldump_all_databases.sql</code>

Add new user and password to sites/default/settings.php

<h4>With phpmyadmin:</h4>

<li>Truncate tables: 'cache*', 'watchdog', 'sessions'.</li>
<li>Check users and they emails in table 'users' - delete all unnecessary.</li>
<li>If init email and current email are differ - change current email.</li>
<li>Check table 'menu_router table' - unusual paths, 'file_put_contents' and 'assert'.</li>
<li>Check table 'block_custom'.</li>

Compare infected database with good database from old (before infected) backup:

<code>mysqldump --skip-comments --skip-extended-insert -hlocalhost -uroot -p db_name > db_name-infected.sql</code>

<code>mysqldump --skip-comments --skip-extended-insert -hlocalhost -uroot -p db_name > db_name.sql</code>

<code>diff db_name-infected.sql db_name.sql</code>


<h3>Work with site files only</h3>

Download from drupal.org archives with drupal core and all modules. Unpack to new folder.

Copy sites/default/files to new core, libraries and new modules.

Replace with fresh file from new installed drupal /sites/default/files/.htaccess

<code>cp /forge-www/2_fresh_modules/.htaccess sites/default/files</code>

Review code of all own modules and themes in IDE. Line by line. All files.

<h3>drush</h3>

Further on we need special drupal modules for rescue:
www.drupal.org/project/drupalgeddon
www.drupal.org/project/site_audit

<code>drush asec</code>

Clear cache with drush:

<code>drush cc all</code>

Reset password for administrator with uid 1:
<code>drush upwd --password="new-password" admin</code>

After reset passwords for all others users.

<code>drush upwd --password="new-password" editor</code>

<!-- How create new good pass -->


<h3>Work with Drupal</h3>

Run site.

Check that 'php-module' is not enable.

If infected site version and current Drupal core version are deffer - update site with update.php

Check roles and permissions - correct all what necessary.

Check custom blocks again.

Check admin/config/content/formats

Audit as possible: nodes, comments. Look - does anywere (blocks, nodes) used php-filter

Finally install this module: www.drupal.org/project/security_review
After work with this module - disable, uninstall, delete.

Ok, site is clean.
Now it is time to build server defence!
